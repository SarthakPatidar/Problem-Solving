# Minimum Heap [[Code](https://github.com/SarthakPatidar/Problem-Solving/blob/company-wise/geeksforgeeks/src/com/practice/company/amazon/MinHeap)]
* Complete Binary Tree
* Each internal node <= value in children of that node.

## Representation of Min Heap
* A Min heap is typically represented as array.
* If node is stored at index k
    1. Left child Index = 2*k + 1
    2. Right child Index = 2*k - 1
    3. Parent Index = (k-1)/2

## Operations
1. <b>getMin()</b> : It returns the root element of Min Heap. Time Complexity of this operation is O(1).
2. <b>extractMin()</b> : Removes the minimum element from MinHeap. Time Complexity of this Operation is O(Log n) as this operation needs to maintain the heap property (by calling heapify()) after removing root.
3. <b>insert()</b> : Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree. If new key is larger than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
